# Don't make up some files/folders without confirmation.

To persist consistency, we need to ensure that all files and folders are properly managed and tracked. This includes creating, updating, and deleting files and folders in a controlled manner.

Every time we need to create a new file at some non-legacy location, we have to ensure that we can easily locate it and manage it sustainably, so those kinds of action requires a new **rule** to be created. Before that, we don't create any new files which are not followed by a rule.
